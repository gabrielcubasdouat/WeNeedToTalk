“I'm not really bragging when I say that I have my shit together. I'm not consistent enough to make myself feel confident. So know for a fact that I am not bragging when I say that. Although I will always admit that I am very lucky to be here, in a good house, with a good family and doing a job that pays the bills and satisfy me. I will always throw onto luck what I’ve gathered with a lot of hard work and well thought out plans. From a very young age to the age I am in now I’ve worked tirelessly to mature and find myself introspectively and socially. That process requires me to be in a state of mind that has not yet turned into a habit. Even though enough years have passed that, at this point, it should had probably already become one. It hasn’t. Yet, curiously, the idea that I will never experience true happiness has indeed become a habit and a constant state of mind. I think it’s so because, in every single moment of my life, I am unsure if I’m truly and utmost productive towards my own best self interest. Not because of poor life planning, nor for a lack of try harding. But for pure and evil ignorance. 
I take ignorance in a very literal and aesthetic way. I mean ignorance as in: unaware of certain facts or; ignoring a fact purposefully. I am consistently ignorant. And I am aware of that. So in every action or thought I generate I immediately doubt if I am behaving in the best manner possible. It may seem a dark and tiresome modus operandi to have. But I do have it. I am sure of it. But let’s say that maybe I’m wrong to assume that I doubt my own decision making process every time it manifests itself in my life. Paradoxically, even questioning the validity of the phrase comproves that it is impossible to prove the exact opposite of that situation. Even if I doubt something for a slight millisecond, it already goes down the category of second guessing and I’m left with uncertainty. Proving, therefor, that it is most certainly true that I am completely unsure of every decision I have ever made in my life. Not only can I come to that logical conclusion, but I could also provide enough evidence in my life to prove it to be probabilistically and mathematically true. Most certainly no one will care about that later form of explanation since everyone can relate to this specific state of mind.”
This note was found on the computer files of the one man that is the exception to this rule, Hector.
<br>
<br>
Hector is a simple man, living life with all the ease of a confident guy He wakes up every morning with a huge smile on his face, kisses his asleep wife on the lips and heads to work in his car. He smiles at everyone and, when he smiles, he has a slight inclination on both his eyebrows towards the nose. Indicating that, not only does he want you to know that he is happy, but he also wants you to know that he is full of masculine energy. He’s ready to beat your ass up if you try to mess with him. 
He is tall, but not freakishly tall. He is just the right amount of tall that makes him distinguishable from most people in most of the places he frequents. His hair is almost golden. It flows naturally to the right, so he always seems to be on a good hair day. His eyebrows are thick and made out of straight lines and right angles. Has a strong jaw. He smells like sweet honey mustard mixed with camomile and a dash of barbecue smoke. He also has a perfectly sculpted gym body underneath his working attire. He Is a man's man. The type of man that goes to work, the gym, the bar with his friends and still manages to pick his kids from school at the end of the day. He likes having dinner with his family and later fucking his wife after a long day of work.
<br>
<br>
He works in a stable job. One of those where you can't really be fired from. He earned his spot there, so he deserves to stay there forever or until he decides to live it for a better job. He works in his own office with a view and he has a secretary that often flirts with him. He never acknowledges her, but he’s always aware of the fact. He thinks about her when he has sex with his wife every night. His job is fully automate, so he only has to make a couple of decisions per day and fill in some forms online.
<br>
<br>
One particular day at his job a lady appeared in his office without knocking. The lady expressed sincere confidence in her voice as she said:
- Mr. Hector, I am so glad to be able to reach you in such a short notice. You've been awarded as one of the few lucky people to ever receive the highly praised Mr. Confidence award. The president would like to give you his sincere gratitude for all your services and for being so confident all these years. Please, come with me so I can take you to your prize now.
He didn't hesitated for one second. The lady pointed her arm in a slow motion to the direction of the prize. She was pointing at a door in the middle of his office. A door which Hector never before noticed to be there. Hector opened and entered the door excited for his prize.
- Enjoy your stay Mr. Hector, I won't be bothering you anymore.
She closed the door leaving Hector alone and speechless in the room. He still had a smile and a slight inwards inclination of the eyebrows. He was perplexed, yet confident that something good could happened at any moment. He knew he deserved that room. He called for the lady after a few minutes went by. After another few minutes, Hector looked around the empty room in hopes to find his prize.
Many hours had passed and he didn't felt any hunger. He also noticed that he didn't had to use the bathroom. He wasn’t hot nor cold. He wasn’t tired nor energetic. He was completely satisfied  in every sense of the word and didn't feel any biological urges whatsoever. He later tried jerking off. However he couldn't get his trusty friend to satisfy his needs, since he didn’t had any. 
He then felt weird about it so he went for the door. It was the only object in this empty and white room. The door was locked. The harder he tried opening the door, the less possible it seemed that he could open it. First, he broke the handle, because he tried to twisting it too roughly. Then, he broke the corks that kept the door in place, because he was screaming and banging on it. Lastly, he decided to charge the door with his shoulder repeatedly to break it down. That's when the entire wooden door shattered on the floor, showing that behind it was nothing more than a solid white wall, which made it completely impossible to escape his prize.
<br>
<br>
He panicked internally for a few minutes. He hyperventilated and cried. Later he stopped that because he realized that the tears and the breath weren’t serving him like they used to. That made him fall into a deep depression. He didn't needed to sleep, so he stayed up all night trying to set up a plan to escape that situation. The room was too quiet to think. So he gave up coming up with a plan and decided to bang his head on the walls in order to demonstrate to himself physically what was going on inside his mind. 
<br>
<br>
For the sight, he kept his eyes opened as he thrusted his head back and forth towards the wall. Indicating to his body that even though he was in a quiet and still room, his mind was chaotic and unpredictable. For the hearing, the sound of his skull hitting the solid rock wall generated not only a crunching and impactful sound, caused by the strong slam on the wall in every bump. But, at the same time, it made a soft and delayed sound, caused by the skin being deteriorated a bit more in every hit. That impacted on the sonority of every coalision, reminding him of how visceral and delicate the suffering was. For the taste, his blood, sweat and tears culminated in his mouth generating a taste he never before tasted. An ever increasingly disgusting and provocative taste, reminding him the disgust of the event. For the smell, the recognizable smell of blood. That smell that remind one of rust, fungus and rotten meat. That made both his nostrils physically shrink and generate mucus. Alerting him of all the toxicity about that moment. But nothing felt worse than the ridiculous and gruesome amounts of physical pain from banging his head with a strength he never thought he could willingly apply to himself.
<br>
<br>
I’m sorry for the brutal example that I had to make out of my friend Hector. But in a society where confidence is power, confidence must be suspected and dealt with accordingly. Hector was a good friend of mine, but his sacrifice was necessary.
