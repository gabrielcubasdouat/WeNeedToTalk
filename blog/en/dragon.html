	<h1>The Dragon and the Manatee</h1>

When you can't push any further try and right something. See what your subconscious has to tell you

For the past few days I haven't been able to remember my dreams as much. I mostly remember flashes and incomplete sentences. I wish I could confront my dreams as I think I do, head on, no fear, look into the Dragon’s eyes and say: “ I’m afraid of you, but I’m not running”. Everyday of my life the Dragon from my dreams, with it’s fixating bright yellow eyes, is a constant reminder that I am not in control of myself. The Dragon could shred me into pieces, but it doesn’t, it just sits there. Sometimes the Dragon do some flips and spits fire, sometimes it goes down into the endless dark pit it comes from, but most of the time it just stares at me, without moving. The Dragon is so big I can’t even see its whole body. It is so big  that you just can’t grasp its actual size. I never actually get to see it’s whole body in my dreams, as his enormous body is always partly submerged in the depths of the darkness it comes from. That’s terrifying to me.
<br>
<br>

I want to construct the Dragon as a Him. But It won’t let me define It that way. On the other hand, I don’t really think of It as a She. The Dragon can change from a He, to a She, to an It... It’s ambiguous like that... Something also tells me that It loves me. I can see it in It’s eyes. It’s always looking at me, angry, thinking, waiting. 
She always wants my attention. 
He only wants to challenge me. 
But, at the end, I know It just wants me dead.

<br>
I have a long tail, because monkeys need to be pulled back every once in a while. The Dragon pulls my tail if I get too far away from It. But we monkeys don’t like being stuck and strapped. We want to fly and run around free, without that bully dragging us down. We, monkeys, think it’s lonely to sit here at the same place every day, looking at the Dragon, doing nothing... but there is nowhere else to go, nothing else to do! So we just give the Dragon a chance, and we sit here looking, waiting to see if the Dragon would do something for us.
But this story isn’t about how boring my life is. Oh no! This story is about the one time I was a bad monkey and I looked away from the Dragon!
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	Curiosity
</h2>
Now, you might be wondering, what an obvious thing to do! You’d might think: “Why wouldn’t you look away and see what's around, you stupid monkey?” Of course! But everything is obvious after you’ve done it. I’ve never been so bored and courageous as to actually do something about it. And also, who the f*ck would look away from a thing that is probably a million times bigger than you - maybe even bigger - and who could do unimaginably horrible things to you in a blink of an eye?
<br>
<br>
But, as I already mentioned, this story is about the one day that I actually got too lonely, too depressed, too bored and I decided to look away from the Dragon just a little bit. 
The thought behind it was that I actually preferred to die rather than to be bored another minute. 
<br>
<br>
I shifted my eyeballs just a liiiittle to the side. The Dragon didn’t do anything. And so I turned a little bit more, now with some body movement too... The Dragon didn’t do anything. So I turned A LOT more, almost 180 degrees. 
This time, I started to hear the Dragon’s roar. It was spitting fire, I could still see It in the corner of my sight. I froze with fear for a few seconds from losing It form my sight. But then, I realized that the sound was moving further away from me, as if the Dragon was getting further the more I turned. Who would’ve thought?
<br>
<br>
And then I understood what was going on. When the fear passed, I regained control of my senses and I realised that the only reason the Dragon was there in the first place was because I never left It alone. Now It was alone, and so was I.
“Wow! What should I do now? Where to go? What to do?”, I thought.
The first thing that came to my attention was a bright blue light, contrasting from the red light that was emanating from the Dragon’s fire behind me on the dark pit.
I started to hear a soothing purring sound, which took up the entire space around me, I could feel the vibrations of the purr embrace my whole body. At this point I was laughing and crying at the same time, it was all so intense! 
<br>
<br>
I realized the Dragon wasn’t my destiny. From It’s opposite direction came the most magnificent feeling I’ve had ever felt in my entire life! I looked to find a source for this magnificent feeling. And there it was, at a distance, exactly opposed to the Dragon, was a giant grey Manatee, floating around majestically, purring, dancing in a big purple ocean of possibilities.
Maybe that’s why the Dragon was so furious all the time, maybe It was insecure that I could prefer this majestic feeling over his scary face. 
It was the most beautiful and soothing thing I’ve had ever seen in my insignificant monkey life. 
But then, as fast as it came, the feeling went away.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Why did it last so little? What could I have done to make it last longer? I though: “Maybe I should get closer to this Manatee”.
Differently from the Dragon, the Manatee was moving around a lot and you could see everything behind It: the stars; galaxies; planets; other types of creatures. The Manatees size never once startled me. Quite the opposite, the view was so overwhelmingly beautiful and thrilling that for once I didn’t care about anything, other than getting that feeling again. From then on out I would only care about the opportunity that this giant beast had to offer. 
The Manatee was gigantic, but like the Dragon, you couldn’t quite grasp his size. Not because it was hiding in the dark, like that dirty old Dragon, but because I couldn’t tell how far away it was from me. Maybe the Manatee was very small and very close, or maybe he was even bigger than the Dragon but very far away. Still, my monkey brain was mesmerized by everything.
<br>
<br>

</h2>
<br>
<br>
At this point, I couldn’t hear the Dragon’s roar at all. Because of said silence, I could tell he was in great pain and agony down at the dark abyss, Dragons don't usually emote well…
Even though I felt bad and kind of guilty for leaving the Dragon, I was too busy looking at the Manatee and trying to figure out how to get closer to him. And so I didn’t care about the Dragon’s suffering as much. Foolish monkey… I thought everything was under control until I smelled something burning. 
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	Confrontation
</h2>
<br>
<br>
All of the sudden, I felt my tail burn. It hurted like hell. And because of the pain I instinctively looked back at the Dragon. 
Only then I realized how much time had passed since I left the Dragon alone. I almost couldn’t see him anymore, he was so far into the darkness. I could only see the fire sprouting out from a distance and It’s opened mouth screaming, pleading me for help. 
I felt two things I had never felt before: first, I felt proud. The Dragon was suffering because of me, which meant it did love me and needed me; but secondly, I felt ashamed, as I realized that maybe the Manatee didn’t care about me as much as the Dragon does. 
All this time I was looking at the Manatee, and not once did It looked back at me (or even acknowledged me, at all… What a d*ck!). I wanted my Dragon back! 
<br>
Between the flames and the fog I tried to figure out where the Dragon’s eyes were. Maybe I could take a look inside of them and calm It down. I eventually found them. When our eyes locked, it started to arise from the shadows with amazing speed. Speed like i’ve never seen before. I was so afraid, I felt every hair in my body stiff up as if they were needles entering my skin. The moment was never ending, even though it ended quite quickly. 
As it got closer to me I understood: It wasn’t rushing for love, It was rushing for revenge. It’s body knocked me out cold and I fell into It’s darkness. 
<br>
I was hurt badly, I couldn’t fly anymore, I felt cursed, unbalanced. I felt like I’d never stop falling into the darkness. I didn’t had the strength to do anything about it. 
I hit the ground. I was now in the bottom of the abyss.
<br>
<br>
I woke up, I was afraid. I felt as if there was nowhere else to go. But then something changed.
It’s a funny thing when you hit the bottom of the abyss. When the darkness from your nightmares are all of the sudden right in front of you, you realise that the dark is just... Dark! And why are monkeys so afraid of the dark? Because we don’t know what's behind the darkness. But know I did knew, and it was just more darkness, there was nothing to be afraid of.
<br>
<br>
Then I remembered about the Manatee. I wondered if I could see him from so far below the shadows. I looked up, and there It was, floating as It always did, in the same place he was before. I still couldn’t understand how far or close It was, but for some reason I knew It was further away. After taking some time looking at the Manatee, I was sure that there was nowhere else to go, but up! Towards the Manatee!
After resting for a while I started to float back up. And as my strength got back, I flew the fastest I could towards the Manatee. The more I flew, the more invencible I felt. It took me a long time until I got to the place where I started this story, my starting place of balance. To get there required great strength, increasing strength really. When I got back to that place I felt strong like never before, I could fly wherever I wanted to (or at least it felt like that). So I flew even faster then before towards the Manatee.
But then, I remembered.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	Forgiveness
	
</h2>
<br>
<br>
I remembered how hard it was for the Dragon to be in the darkness all alone, and how angry It was at me when I neglected It. It got so mad that it dragged me into the abyss It comes from. I was no longer afraid of the Dragon. Because now I knew It’s strength. I knew the damage It could do to me if I denied It for too long. I looked back down to the abyss and I could see nothing, neither the Dragon nor the abyss, I flew to fast towards the Manatee. I had a choice, go forward and keep chasing the Manatee or go back and understand how big the Dragon actually is and why It is so obsessed with me. I decided to go back, because no matter how fast I flew, the Manatee never seemed to get any closer to me, it was worthless to fly towards him.
<br>
<br>
So I flew back with great pride to find my Dragon. I was a proud monkey. I knew it wouldn’t be an easy task to understand my Dragon, but I had nothing better to do.
<br>
<br>
<h2>

</h2>
<br>
<br>
As I got closer to the abyss, the Dragon showed up and started to rush towards me again. Now I had more strength than before, so I decided to attack him back. Our eyes locked once more, and he turned bright yellow with rage. As our bodies clashed, I broke every single bone in my body, and the Dragon only had a scratch. It started screaming and crying. The Dragon couldn’t take the pain even from such a small scratch. It hid itself back into the darkness. I realized something very important that moment, the Dragon is very sensitive. 
I should be more careful with It. 
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	Passion
	
</h2>
<br>
<br>
With every bone broken, I had no strength to fly, so I looked up at the Manatee and, again, I slowly started to regain my strength. Eventually I was able to fly, and once more I went looking for the Dragon. This time, more carefully.
<br>
<br>
I found the Dragon, It was asleep. This was the first time I thought the Dragon looked beautiful. I wanted to fly around to understand how big It was, so I was very quiet. When I flew up and down a couple of times I saw It’s full size. It kept getting smaller and smaller every time I looked from It’s head to It’s tail. I was very lucky It was asleep. 
But then It woke up.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	Snapping back
</h2>
<br>
<br>
There I was again, in the place where nightmares happened, the bottom of the abyss with the Dragon as close as possible to me. The Dragon crushed me into pieces. I was very badly hurt. But I prefered to die than to give up on the Dragon. 
After the beating I felt no fear, I felt enriched, happier, and I felt like from now on there was nowhere else but up. I understood the Dragon.
<br>
<br>
But how would I get up? I could no longer see the Manatee and I had no more strength in my body, and so I panicked.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	 Confrontation
</h2>
<br>
<br>
Now it was me and the Dragon in the abyss. I felt suffocated and lost. Alone. I had no strength anymore, so I asked the Dragon if It could help me out. If It did, I promised to never forget to look at It again. It concurred, so It putted me on It’s back and rose me high enough so that I could at least see the Manatee, and my strength started to come back.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	 Forgiveness
</h2>
<br>
<br>
Eventually I could fly without the Dragon. 
But now It started to follow me where I went, It was always close and trustworthy. The Manatee, however, still felt far away. Actually the Manatee never got any closer, so I gave up chasing It after a while.
<br>
<br>
<h2>
	•	 Equilibrium
	
</h2>
<br>
<br>
Eventually I decided to go back to my place of equilibrium, where the Dragon and the Manatee could both be part of my life. I had to learn how to take turns looking at the Manatee and the Dragon. Later I realized I could understand the Manatee’s movements. When he went left, I went left, when he went right, I went right, when he wiggled his tail, so did I. 
But because now the Dragon was following me, the Dragon started to imitate my movements. And then I realized… we were all dancing. Us three. Together. I discovered that I would be doing that dance for the rest of my life, and that was fine! 
Maybe I’ve been doing that dance even before all of this happened, just in a very slow pace at the beginning. Maybe one day the Manatee will get closer and acknowledge me and my Dragon. Or maybe there are other monkeys dancing with their own Dragons, following the same Manatee as me. I don’t know, but until I find out, I’ll just keep dancing.
