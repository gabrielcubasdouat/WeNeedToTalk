Head first
</h1>

	Jumping headfirst into the thing you love may shatter you into pieces. That’s why it’s so hard to jump into something (or someone) you love, because the jump is not actually just that one jump. The “jump” is committing to it a million times until something good comes out. Love is truly fucked up.
<br>
<br>

How come everyone is obsessed with the idea of jumping head first and getting something out of it? Why are humans attracted to stories about the mad underdog who kept doing something hurtful and crazy but it turns out that he/she was right all along? I think most people jump head first and then they realise nothing good is coming out, so they leave. And that's normal. That works. If it's too much effort, it shouldn't be worth it.
<br>
<br>
It shouldn't be worth it. Then why do we keep doing it? Why keep banging your head against the ground, full force, every day, when you don’t know exactly what the outcome will be? I've banged my head enough times to understand that it is impossible to predict if something good will come out of it. During the process of cracking your skull on the floor, pain doesn't really matter. For people in love with something or someone, the opposite of pain is nothing. The only thing that matters during it is what you leave behind. Is that blood stain you left on the floor after you banged your head on it a million times. Is the fact that the blood stain looks like a smiley face. And that that bloody smile is making someone else smile. Then, because they liked the smile you left behind after you died of exhaustion, they start smashing their heads onto the same spot, so their blood will eventually take the shape of something fun also, like a balloon, a bloody balloon. Soon enough the blood of the innocent who died trying to accomplish something impossible by banging their heads on that same spot that you did, for no particular reason, becomes a happy conjunction of many different bloody images. And it makes people happy (the people who weren’t crazy enough to do it, that is). They didn't feel what the people who did it felt. The ones who don’t do it will never feel the immeasurable pain and suffering that took for that unpredictable happy and cheerful bloody result.
<br>
<br>
But that also doesn't matter. None of that really fucking matters. We bang our heads on the wall until blood comes out. The end. No punchline. Nothing. It's that simple. We beat our heads over and over again for no reason.
<br>
<br>
Maybe some lucky bastard will be the one to crack that fucking floor open. Maybe it will crumble into pieces along with the blood of a billion different people who helped it a little every time their skull came in contact with that cold solid surface. And maybe what's beyond the floor will fucking matter. I don't know. All I know is that my head fucking hurts right now.
