To scream or not to scream
</h1>

<br>
<br>
I numbly push emotions down when I need to scream. I need to vocalize my anger, my discontent, my fears. However, I often feel inclined to alter my necessity for screaming, and so I get quiet, to please others. I do it to be stable and kind within my social environment. People don't like when others scream in anger. And I want to be around people. In fact, I need to be surrounded by people to survive. I want to help others and be part of something. But, how can I manage both necessities at the same time?
<br>
<br>
I will die eventually, and I need to make a decision on how to lead my life. What should I do with my mutually exclusive necessities? Are there ways of making them converge? Could I manage to scream my insecurities and still be in a tribe? What do I need to do to be able to scream and keep people I love around me?
<br>
<br>
Today I went to my first Jiu Jitsu lesson and I learned that people scream not only for anger. I saw 50 tough men and women screaming at the top of their lungs the word "OSS" about 10 times throughout a 50 minutes class. Every time we gathered as a group to start the class, learn a new stance, take a break, or whatever the reason, everyone shouted together: "OSS!". I looked it up, and OSS is the Japanese term for acceptance, or acknowledgement, utilized in the martial arts communities. So, if you think about it, all they are basically doing is screaming the word "Yes!", over and over again. But, why? I think they scream "Yes!" to the inevitable challenge ahead. They scream "Yes!" to the pain that is life, instead of crying and screaming "No!". They stand strong together and scream "OSS", and then they get to fight with each other all they like, because they got to scream before dealing with the hardest part.
<br>
<br>
If you need to scream, remember that you are not alone. But scream the pain away in a positive way. As in a way to wish for something better. And do it with other people. The screams are outbursts of overwhelming emotions. Don't get overwhelmed, exhale, you can scream in many ways: with your voice, with your hands, with your entire body. I scream a lot, the most effective for me is writing. It makes me release all the pain inside my head in a very precise way. It unclogs the machinery. I never know what I'll write about when I start, and it often starts sad, but I write until I find a happy ending. I write until my depressive question becomes a hopeful conclusion filled with love and hope, and then I send it to the people that can benefit from it, and I hope we benefit from it, as a group.
